## Description

Hip Eats is a clone-site of UberEats. 

This project is done with a purpose to test your knowledge in:
- Reactjs (Create React-App)
- HTML
- CSS/SASS with TailwindCSS
- Javascript/Typescript
- React-Router-Dom v6
- React-Icons
- **Bonus:** Add automation-testing framework Cypress.io
- **Upgrade:** Make use of Headless CMS (Content Management System) such as WordPress, Netlify-CMS, Contentful, etc.

## Setup

### Development
1. Clone the project or download src-code as ZIP from *staging* branch.
2. This project is bootstraped using yarn, so to install dependencies simply run `yarn`.
3. Once all dependencies are installed, to start the development server simply run `yarn start`.
4. Have fun tweaking the project to your own-liking! ðŸš€

### Project Structure

- All source code is inside the `/src` folder.
- Reusable components are inside the `/src/components` folder. If you create a new component, please remember to import it into `/src/components/index.js` as this is the central-logbook to all of the exported components to be used elsewhere.
- Sample data is inside `/src/data/sample.js`. You do not have to use this. If you prefer, you can create an API or fetch from fake-APIs to load up your data.
- Pages are inside `/src/pages`.
- Types are defined inside `/src/types/index.ts`.
- `/src/App.js` contains all the routes defined for this project.
- As I am using TailwindCSS, I only have one CSS file that is `/src/index.css`. *Note:* You can set your default theme, utilities-class, etc on `tailwind.config.js`. Read TailwindCSS documentation to know more.

### Testing

Testing result is documented in the pull-requests.

*Future works:*

## Feature

- Filter list of top-rated food by categories.
- Filter list of top-rated food by pricing.
- Add food to cart.
- Remove selected food from cart.
- View site on mobile/tablet mode.

- [x] Mobile-friendly.
- [x] Able to filter menu items by category: All, Burgers, Italian, etc.
- [x] Able to filter menu items by pricing.

- [ ] *Upgrade:* Fetch data from CMS (Contenful, Netlify-CMS, WordPress, etc).
- [ ] *Upgrade:* create & run e2e regression testing on CI/CD pipeline.

### Out of Scope
This project will exclude any payment system i.e. the (backend) Cart function is out of scope. Hip Eats solely focusing on building the UI layout, components, and design/UX.

Not all sidebar-nav-menu have links attached. Only the `Orders` nav will work and direct user to Orders page.
